    "description":"I went into depression, as I couldnt make something cool like linux, unix etc. I was like kinda totally given up, as web programmers get output in seconds. As an assembly programmer, it was really difficult for me to move along with awesome working results , so I took a break from assembly moved on to Web Technologies and my first project with webtechnologies is an Image processing library.
